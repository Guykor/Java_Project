=          Design           =
=============================
I implemented the Library class to allow updating the status of the library books holdings, and its registered
 patrons. In this way, the book and patrons instances are independent, and library just holds only it's
 registered items, allowing same book or patron registered in several libraries.


=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In the library I've created arrays to hold the books in the library (aka bookShelf) and the registered patrons
(aka patronDb). all other details that were relevant to registering a patron or a book and checking their
status, is being checked dynamically on demand, reducing number of variables to avoid mistakes.
